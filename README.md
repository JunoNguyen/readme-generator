    AS a developer, I want to write professional README.md files SO I can better explain my purpose and code to my audience.
## Description
    This project generates a README.md file when you run it within the integrated terminal. You must have node installed as well as inquirer. Run "npm i" to install inquirer, from there you can run "node index.js" to receive a prompt
## Usage
    Fork the repository, run the "index.js" file within your integrated terminal. YOU MUST RUN "npm i" prior to running "node index.js" because inquirer is required for this code.
## Built With
    Javscript
